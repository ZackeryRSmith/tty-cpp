# Experimental Tests

Please note that the tests in this directory are currently experimental, meaning that there is a good chance that errors may occur. Additionally, some of the older tests may not be up-to-date with the newest functions from TTY-CPP.

If you're looking for up-to-date and error-free examples, please refer to the examples directory instead.
